# classification-on-tumor-dataset-using-CNN
data analytics first project - spring 2024 - Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)

in this project, we used a set of black and white MRI brain images to create a CNN network for classification. 
using the trained model the presence or absence of a brain tumor can be reported. 

in the first part we did the preprocessing of the data which includes deviding the dataset to train, validation and test data.
